About me:
I'm a senior at BYU-I studying cloud computing. I currently work full time as a caregiver for Empowering Human Services in Idaho Falls. I enjoy coding, building/ fixing computers, psychology, and sociology. I started off college as a communications student but lost interest because of the limited emphases available for that major. A key aspect of who I am centers on trying to factor life's abstract problems into their formulaic patterns and relationships so I can solve them and share their solutions as credibly and compellingly as possible. 

Skills and Technologies:
So far I've worked with Python, HTML/CSS, C#, and Cisco IOS for network configuration and troubleshooting.

Projects and Work:
This is my latest project. I worked with my team in my business management class last semester to build a proof of concept website for Swamp Donkey Mobile Mechanics:
